You can choose the way you like to open a panel window, which includes:

## Wants to know how to bookmark it?
Of course you can create the bookmark and edit it, but the secret is you can do it in a simpler way:

## v0.4
* Bookmark it!
  * Try appending "#panel" to the URL and bookmark it!
  * Sometimes you need to use "/#panel" if the url does not end with "/".
  * Sometimes "panel://yoururl" would also work
* eg.
  * [http://www.wolframalpha.com/#panel](http://www.wolframalpha.com/#panel)
  * [panel://www.wolframalpha.com](panel://www.wolframalpha.com)

Sometimes "panel://yoururl" won't work because Google will search it, so PiP will also parse the url generated by Google Search, more specifically the url contains "q=panel%3A%2F%2Fyoururl"

## v0.3.1
* Can open url without prefix like "http://"
* Add option for automatically open current tab in panel window
